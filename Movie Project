#This project utilizes the following movie data
CREATE TABLE movies (
	id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	title TEXT,
	released INTEGER

INSERT INTO movies VALUES (1, "Tenet", 2020);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (2, "Wonder Woman 1984", 2020);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (3, "Soul", 2020);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (4, "The Midnight Sky", 2020);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (5, "Godzilla vs. Kong", 2021);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (6, "A Quiet Place Part II", 2021);

#For this project I used SQL to query the movie database to disover which movies where released after the year 2020.

Select *
FROM movies
WHERE released>2020
ORDER BY released desc
